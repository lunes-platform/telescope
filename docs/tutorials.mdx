## How to Lunes Node works

The Lunes Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed network based on the LPoS consensus algorithm. This network can be mainnet or testnet, in mainnet the nodes work with real values of tokens, currencies, NFT and assets. On the other hand, testnet has "fake" tokens to provide a test environment.
In the dev language, mainnet is prod and testnet is dev.

Lunes Node is a node or server that has the responsibility to maintain and validate the blockchain, broadcast new transactions and provide an api for interaction and integration with the network.

With a Lunes Node you become a Lunes Blockchain participant and can provide network resiliency, validate data, and integrate real-world services into the blockchain.
