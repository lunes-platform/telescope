# 🏁 Getting Started

## 🗺 Intro

The **Lunes SDK** helps developers manage their wallets and transact simply and securely,
providing a variety of functionality for decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain integrations.

**The transaction concept here will be any type of write interaction with the lunes blockchain.**
In this way, we can create a transaction to transfer tokens, a transaction to create tokens, a transaction to burn tokens,
a transaction to mint an NFT, etc.

## 🛰 Lunes Node

The Lunes Blockchain is a decentralized and distributed network based on the LPoS consensus algorithm.
This network can be mainnet or testnet, in mainnet the nodes work with real values of tokens, currencies, NFT and assets.
On the other hand, testnet has "fake" tokens to provide a test environment.
**In the dev language, mainnet is prod and testnet is stage**.

Lunes Node is a fuul-node or server that has the responsibility to maintain and validate the blockchain,
broadcast new transactions and provide an api for interaction and integration with the network.

Running a Lunes Node, you become a participant in the Lunes Blockchain and can provide network resiliency,
validate data, receive rewards and can expose an API to broadcast transactions and integrate real-world services into the blockchain.
