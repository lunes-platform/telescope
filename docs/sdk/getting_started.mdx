# üèÅ Getting Started

## Intro

The **Lunes SDK** brings developers closer to the Lunes Blockchain,
providing a range of functionality for decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain integrations.
This helps developers to manage their wallets and make transactions simply and securely.

The library is driven-transactions on the _lunesnode_ architecture.
**The transaction concept here will be any type of interaction with the lunes blockchain.**
In this way, we can create a transaction to transfer tokens, a transaction to create tokens, a transaction to create a nickname (alias) for our account, etc.
