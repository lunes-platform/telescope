## Wallet

A **Wallet** like is an e-mail account, which instead of having _address@provider_ and _password_ has:

- seed: list of random words used to generate keys and address
- chain: blockchain fork, can be mainnet or testnet
- nonce: number used to generate new keys with the same seed
- private key: key used to sign transactions
- public key: key derived from the private key used to derive the address
- address: public address used to receive assets


The wallet can be generated for testnet or mainnet, **this will only change the address**.
The seed used to create a wallet must be a list of 12 or more words out of a list of 2048 words, **[see word list](https://github.com/lunes-platform/lunespy/blob/468cca1cca87b1942e537c82889cd118dc66c9df/lunespy/wallet/constants.py#L8)**.
The chance of two equal wallets to be created is $\frac 1 {2048^n}$ where $n$ is the number of words.
You can generate a wallet by passing your `seed` or `private key` as parameters or **nothing to generate a new one**.
By changing the nonce it is possible to generate **4,294,967,295** different wallets with the same seed.
