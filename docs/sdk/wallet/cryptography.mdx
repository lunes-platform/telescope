# üîê Cryptography

## A **Wallet** like is an e-mail account, which instead of having _address@provider_ and _password_ has:

- seed: list of random words used to generate keys and address
- chain: blockchain fork, can be mainnet or testnet
- nonce: number used to generate new keys with the same seed
- private key: key used to sign transactions
- public key: key derived from the private key used to derive the address
- address: public address used to receive assets

## The wallet can be generated for testnet or mainnet. **This will only change the address**.

## The seed used to create an wallet must be a list of 12 or more words, it is possible to generate a seed with up to 2048 words.

## The chance of two equal wallets to be created is $\frac 1 {2048^n}$ where $n$ is the number of words.

## You can generate a wallet passing your `seed`, `private key`, `public key` and `address` as **parameters** or nothing to generate a new one.

## Changing the nonce is possible generate 4 294 967 295 different wallets with only one seed.
