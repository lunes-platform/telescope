## Amount of Lunes

Amount necessary for Validating Blocks and Earn Tokens is **5000 Lunes**.

## Leased Proof-of-Stake


In this consensus algorithm, the node responsible for validating a block is randomly drawn.
However, the node that has **saved** (stake) **5000 Lunes** or more is more likely to be drawn.
The more Lunes saved (stake), the greater the chance of being drawn to validate a block and receive the reward.
It is also possible to receive Lunes for your full node through **Lease**, and increase your changes with the same balance in your wallet.
To encourage users to lend you through Lease offers reward, token, etc...

When the lunes are leased, they **are not transferred**, they are just locked in the user's own wallet.
**Responsibility for paying rewards lies with the full node administrator, NOT A BLOCKCHAIN MECHANISM**.

### Lease process

Lease is the process of lending your lunes to a full node administrator who has more than 5000 lunes
and receiving rewards, previously agreed by him, whether in tokens, lunes, points etc...
