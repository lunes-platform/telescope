# 🌎 Hello World!

Welcome to the Telescope. Here you can find technical content for build on top of Lunes Blockchain.
Lunes is token-drive blockchain created in 2015 with goal be fast and simple to support the new Token Economics.
Lunes is different because Tokens on Lunes are not built with smart contracts, it are Native Tokens!
Lunes is a proof-of-stake blockchain. By design, it consumes much less energy and computational power.
To get the most out of the Telescope, you should have programming experience and a basic understanding of blockchain concepts, such as UTxO, transactions, addresses, key derivation, and networking.

## 😊 Who we are

**Lunes is a token-driven, modular blockchain-based platform open to everyone.**

## 🔭 Vision

**Be a simple, modular and expandable blockchain for everyone.**

## 🏗 How

**Decoupling components and writing accurate, readable documentation for everyone to contribute.**

## ✅ What is Done

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Lunes Node" label="🛰 Lunes Node" default>


The **Lunes Protocol** is a decentralized and distributed network based on the LPoS consensus algorithm.
This network can be mainnet or testnet, in mainnet the nodes work with real values of tokens, currencies, NFT and assets.
On the other hand, testnet has "fake" tokens to provide a test environment.
**In the dev language, mainnet is prod and testnet is stage**.

Lunes Node is a fuul-node or server that has the responsibility to maintain and validate the blockchain,
broadcast new transactions and provide an api for interaction and integration with the network.

Running a Lunes Node, you become a participant in the Lunes Blockchain and can provide network resiliency,
validate data, receive rewards and can expose an API to broadcast transactions and integrate real-world services into the blockchain.


| MAINNET | TESTNET |          |

The **Lunes SDK** helps developers manage their wallets and transact simply and securely,
providing a variety of functionality for decentralized applications (DApps) and blockchain integrations.

**The transaction concept here will be any type of write interaction with the lunes blockchain.**
In this way, we can create a transaction to transfer tokens, a transaction to create tokens, a transaction to burn tokens,
a transaction to mint an NFT, etc.
